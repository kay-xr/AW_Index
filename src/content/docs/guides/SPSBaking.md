title: Baking SPS for use with Modular Avatar or without VRCFury.
description: This will go through baking a penetrator / plug with SPS for use without VRCFury.

I have a really annoying issue with SPS, where I cannot easily bake anything to be used with another processor. This becomes an issue when you are working on a model that will be sent to others, and do not want to force them to include the entire VRCFury. For now we can bake our components for use without the entire VRCFury package being installed. This also gives us much more room when creating animations, along with being able to remove functionality that isn't needed, such as OSC haptics. It also allows us to only include what we need to with SPS, as VRCFury likes to do many things to our animator that I do not want it to, and there seems to be no easy way to stop it from doing so.
